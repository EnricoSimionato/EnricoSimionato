<h1 align="left">Hi I'm Enrico Simionato ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm studying computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it).

I'm into AI and all things tech-related, especially digging into natural language processing right now. That's all about teaching computers to understand and generate human language! Who wouldn't want to talk to their computer?

I like sports, especially when it comes to football!

So, if you're into AI, tech, or just want to chat about sports, feel free to check out my GitHub and drop me a line. Let's learn and explore together!
